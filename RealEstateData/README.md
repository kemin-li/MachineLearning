A friend of mine is looking to buy a house in the bay area. So I did some research to see if I can help him gain some insights
on the real estate market. It turns out there are some publicly available real estate transaction data, but not much. So I downloaded
data from Zillow.com and did some visualization to give him a rough idea.
